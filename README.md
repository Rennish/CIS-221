**CIS 221 : WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT** 
This is a unit I teach our students at the university. 
At the end of the unit, we expect the students to come up with a working website and a personal portfolio by the end of the semester. 
It is expected that they will endevour to learn more than what is taught in class to prepare themselves for the job market.
